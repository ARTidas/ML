        <h1>Conclusion of the simulation</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Our robots can not find targets.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In the next version we should check if we can program our robots
                        to be able to find the direction of targets.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Our robots can not find move in the direction of targets.
                <ol>
                    Let us see if we can find a way to move our robots.
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                We need to show the targets for the robots.
                <ol>
                    Hopefully by being able to distinguish between edible
                    and inedible and moving into the direction of the 
                    identified targets, we can resolve this.
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Our robots cannot avoid "inedible" targets.
                <ol>
                    We created decision trees in order to solve this task.
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Our robots are not learning anything.
                <ol>
                    We will consider this as a baseline to improve 
                    upon with machine learning algorithms.
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
